Ninja Ball

pinball inspired platformer

journey to the top of the tower to defeat the evil shougun
while avoiding pinball inspired traps and enemies and use the environment to
your advantage to propel yourself through the level.

<character concept art here. and basic diagram of control scheme.>
ninja ball should use a fairly basic platformer move set, left right and jump
whule also being able to press down to "sneak" or interact with certain objects.

*sneaking, possible uses,
make less noise dont alert enemies,
slow down for more acurate movement,
will not allow to fall of edge,
go behind certain objects(furniture tapestries etc) to not be seen

<level example>

the levels of ninjaball are designed to fit the shape of most standard phone screens and to utilise the verticality this provides for
a different feel of platformer as you try to ascend the tower, each level will see you moving upwards towards the goal and utilizing
the various objects such as bumpers flippers switches and doors.

objects to be used <concept art for each shown beside these summaries>
spikes,  kill upon contact
bumpers, use bounce to move ball back in the direction it hit the bumper from.
flippers, throw ball in a certain direction.
spring, fire ball into the next level

*possible object inclusions*
furniture tapestries etc, objects to be hidden behind while sneaking in stealth sections
saw blades, moving obstacles that kill on contact.
switches, flipped to triger certain events, doors opening enemies turning on etc, 
doors, open/ close to deny/allow passage.
enemies, walk around, visible rectangle of vision, attack and  kill on sight(possibly have an idle animation which can be turned on/off by jumping on the enemies head).
